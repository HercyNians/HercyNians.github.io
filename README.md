本人最近在Github社区中新建了一个源代码库，用于开发有关信息技术相关学科的程序，欢迎各位感兴趣的小伙伴们一起参与！本计划是自由公开公有的、完全开源而且任何人都享有使用权。I recently created a new source code library in the Github community for the development of any learning-related programs in the accounting discipline. All interested friends are welcome to participate! This project is free and public, completely open source and anyone can use it.
注意Tips：

      1、本社区和源代码库都是建立在境外社区github，请不要将任何有关国家的信息上传至此！
      
      2、该库内的所有内容受库的创建者管理，未经此库创建者允许，禁止删除库中的任何内容，包括你自己上传的文件！
      All content in the library is managed by the creator of the library. Without the permission of the creator of the library, it is forbidden to delete any content in the library, including the files uploaded by yourself!
      
      3、文件一旦上传至此库，即意味着github社区内甚至社区外的所有人都享有该文件的使用权，在上传你自己的文件前请谨慎考虑！
      Once a file is uploaded to this repository, it means that everyone in the github community or even outside the community has the right to use the file, please consider carefully before uploading your own file!
      
      4、不要将任何有关个人隐私内容、违规内容、涉及版权的内容上传至本库！
      Do not upload any personal privacy content, illegal content, or copyright-related content to this library!
